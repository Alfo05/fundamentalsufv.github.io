my work is about my beautiful country of Costa Rica which I have left to study in Spain
the degree explanation is inside the about me, which is a separate file but is linked in the index file 
I had some difficulties when making the website due to it being 2 years since I last coded in HTML, and didn't remember much
i also had some difficulties when using git wich held me back a bit
but thanks to the classes, i was able to remember some of the things I learned and used them to complete the website to the best of my abilities
